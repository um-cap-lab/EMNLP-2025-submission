half.\\n', 'A:\\tYeah,\\n', 'A:\\tme too.\\n', \"B:\\tI think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them, um, that's what gets to be the really scary part, you know, if you think, when it comes around to income tax time, and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year,\\n\", 'B:\\tyou could really get a lot more stuff if you were just able to pay outright for it.\\n', 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'A:\\tYeah,\\n', \"A:\\tthat's true,\\n\", \"A:\\tthat's true.\\n\", 'A:\\tSeems just like our society is so, um, pushes so hard for, you can have it, you

it's just easier to say, you know, just put that on my credit card.\\n\", \"B:\\tWell that's probably four or five hundred dollars, you know, that goes on at that point\\n\", 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'B:\\tand then it seems like takes forever to pay that off.\\n', \"A:\\tIt's funny, that we've got a Sears card, and we bought a washer and dryer on it, four years ago, and we still owe.\\n\", 'A:\\tI mean, I, I think like half the amount that they cost in the first place.\\n', 'B:\\tWow.\\n', \"A:\\tIt's just, uh, you know, you never, never get it out,\\n\", \"A:\\tand now that's real irritating.\\n\", 'B:\\tIt sure is.\\n', 'B:\\tWe eventually did,\\n', 'B:\\tone time we just borrowed, took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards,\\n', 'B:\\tand the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was, you know, to just have that.\\n', 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', \"B:\\tWe haven't done it lately.\\n\", 'B:\\tWe probably need to do it again.\\n', 'A:\\tWell, we did, you know,\\n',

dollars that we needed for the truck.\\n', 'B:\\tUh-huh.\\n', \"A:\\tAnd they said, sure that's no problem, but, you know, why don't we consolidate your bills,\\n\", 'A:\\tand at the time we thought, Oh, that would be great, you know, we could,\\n', \"A:\\tand it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them,\\n\", 'A:\\tyou only have to write one check a month, not all those.\\n', 'A:\\tYou never miss one or whatever\\n', 'B:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'A:\\tand we did that,\\n', \"A:\\tbut we didn't realize at the time, until several months later, that we, we were real,\\n\", 'A:\\tI mean this was four three years ago,\\n', 'A:\\twe were pretty young\\n', 'A:\\tand we were just kind of like,\\n', 'A:\\twell, I guess that means these credit cards are closed,\\n', \"A:\\tand we didn't, you know,\\n\", 'A:\\tabout six months later we realized we could use them,\\n', 'A:\\tand so we charged them all up again.\\n', 'B:\\tOh, no.\\n', 'A:\\tYeah.\\n', 'A:\\tSo then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before, but also adding the lower payment for all of them,\\n', 'A:\\tSo we were paying like twice.\\n', \"A:\\tUm, so we didn't ever make that mistake again,

it,\\n\", \"A:\\tand then we weren't smart enough to not use it,\\n\", 'A:\\tso.\\n', \"B:\\tYou know, one thing you might do with, in a situation like that, though, it's just like keep,\\n\",

\"A:\\tBut now Plano has quite an elaborate system, don't they?\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', 'B:\\tthey do.\\n', 'B:\\tUh, it started out several years ago when they put these, uh, collection sites they, uh, near a WalMart, near a football stadium and the like,\\n', 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', \"B:\\tand they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up.\\n\", 'B:\\tThese huge dumpsters were being filled up in a, in a matter of a week.\\n', 'B:\\tSo they knew that there was something going on here.\\n', 'B:\\tSo, they started looking into programs,\\n', 'B:\\tand what we have now,\\n', 'B:\\tit, they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano.\\n', 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'B:\\tInstead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week, they make a collection on Monday for yard waste,\\n', \"B:\\tand the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack\\n\", 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', \"B:\\tit's a pretty good size.\\n\", \"B:\\tIt's maybe the size of two or three, um, grocery bags.\\n\", 'A:\\tOh.\\n', 'B:\\tAnd we put that out by the street,\\n', 'B:\\tand they collect those on Monday.\\n', 'B:\\tAnd then on Wednesday, we put out two containers that they gave us.\\n', \"B:\\tOne container's a huge, green, monstrous thing that a, uh, uh, a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck.\\n\", \"B:\\tSo and that's where you put your regular, um, garbage and trash.\\n\", 'A:\\tOkay.\\n', 'B:\\tAnd then also, that same day, you put out a small tub,\\n', \"B:\\tit's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide,\\n\", 'B:\\tand you put, just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper,\\n', 'B:\\tand then the.\\n', 'A:\\tOkay,\\n', 'A:\\tand then they they separate it.\\n', 'B:\\tExactly,\\n', 'B:\\tthey have a big truck that has like not ten, maybe five big doors on the side of it,\\n', 'B:\\tand they throw the different stuff in the different doors.\\n', \"A:\\tOh, that's a neat system.\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah\\n', 'B:\\tit is.\\n', \"B:\\tAnd apparently it's, you know, it, it went off pretty much without a hitch.\\n\", 'B:\\tThe trucks, the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war\\n', 'A:\\tOh, uh-huh.\\n', 'B:\\tthat the trucks were being, the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other.\\n', 'B:\\tBut it does work pretty well.\\n', 'A:\\tWell, I know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano,\\n', 'A:\\tand I know they have commented on the system.\\n', \"A:\\tI don't know that they know that it worked that way,\\n\", 'A:\\tbut they have the two separate containers and stuff.\\n', 'B:\\tOh, yes,\\n', 'B:\\tuh-huh.\\n', 'B:\\tI noticed something interesting last time, I guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up,\\n', 'B:\\tI happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the, that tub stuff,\\n', 'B:\\tand the man who was doing the separating, when he was done emptying the tub, he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt\\n', 'B:\\tand he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub.\\n', 'B:\\tSo they must be collecting information about who does it, and how often.\\n', 'A:\\tOh, that is interesting.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', \"A:\\tBecause I wonder if that means that if you don't do it\\n\", 'B:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'A:\\tdo you suppose they will come and knock on your door and,\\n', \"B:\\tI, I don't know,\\n\", \"B:\\tbut I think that's a really interesting question.\\n\", 'A:\\tThat, that is interesting.\\n', \"A:\\tYou know, will you be penalized if you don't.\\n\", 'A:\\tWill you, uh.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', \"B:\\tthat, that seems farfetched only because it, it, there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs.\\n\", 'A:\\tRight,\\n', 'A:\\tright.\\n', \"B:\\tSo there, there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have.\\n\", \"A:\\tThat's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, uh, cans, you know, from the, the market and, uh you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera.\\n\", 'B:\\tRight.\\n', 'B:\\tNo,\\n', \"B:\\tthey won't take vegetable cans.\\n\", \"A:\\tOh, they don't take vegetable cans.\\n\", 'B:\\tJust, just the aluminum pop cans.\\n', 'A:\\tThis is just their aluminum cans.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', 'A:\\tWell, then yes,\\n', 'A:\\tso they have,\\n', \"A:\\tthat's interesting.\\n\", 'A:\\tI wonder, uh, uh,\\n', 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', \"B:\\twhat they're doing with that.\\n\", \"A:\\tWouldn't you really like to know?\\n\", 'B:\\tI would.\\n', \"B:\\tSomeday I'm sure we'll find out.\\n\", \"A:\\tI'm sure\\n\", 'A:\\tyou know, if nothing else call the sanitation department say, okay,\\n', 'A:\\twhat are you doing reading you know.\\n', 'B:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'B:\\tSo tell me your feelings on recycling.\\n', 'B:\\tIs it, do you think this is a good thing, or silly.\\n', \"A:\\tI think it's a very good thing.\\n\", \"A:\\tI think that, uh, I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it,\\n\", 'B:\\tYes.\\n', \"A:\\tand I can't say that my husband and I are real, real conscientious.\\n\", 'A:\\tWe got started on the aluminum cans because our, uh, grandson was collecting them, uh, to raise money and stuff for an organization he was in.\\n', 'B:\\tYes.\\n', 'A:\\tSo we started collecting them,\\n', \"A:\\tand now he's through,\\n\", \"A:\\tso we've just, we've kept on\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', \"A:\\tand it's interesting, too, that we have to drive, we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, uh, just inside your city limits, to, you know turn them in to dump them in.\\n\", 'B:\\tDump them off.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', 'B:\\tand that is interesting.\\n', \"A:\\tI'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson\\n\", 'B:\\tRight.\\n', \"A:\\tbut we just haven't really seen them advertised or you know, something.\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', 'B:\\tWell, the\\n', 'B:\\tyeah,\\n', 'B:\\tthe Plano newspaper each, each day, in fact, has a, a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things.\\n', 'B:\\tThey publish it every single day.\\n', \"A:\\tWell, that's interesting.\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', 'B:\\tand phone numbers, and, and that kind of stuff.\\n', 'A:\\tUh-huh,\\n', \"A:\\twell, I haven't noticed, uh, I haven't noticed Richardson, you know, making that big a,\\n\", 'A:\\tOkay\\n', 'A:\\ton a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why?\\n', 'B:\\tWell, I guess I stand on, uh, on, probably ten for no, uh, restrictions.\\n', 'B:\\tI, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska,\\n', \"B:\\tand I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms,\\n\", 'B:\\tand I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else,\\n', 'B:\\tbut, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food\\n', 'A:\\tYes,\\n', 'A:\\ttrue.\\n', 'B:\\tand, uh, I was raised, uh, you know, hunting all the time,\\n', 'B:\\tI lived on the farm, and, uh, you know, enjoy hunting\\n', 'B:\\tand I guess I have, uh, some problems with, uh, being restricted to, um, owning a gun for, you know, hunting purposes mainly.\\n', 'A:\\tRight.\\n', 'B:\\tAnd, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.\\n', 'A:\\tYeah,\\n', 'A:\\tI can, I can understand that.\\n', 'A:\\tI was raised in Oklahoma,\\n', 'A:\\tand of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, uh,\\n', 'A:\\tyeah,\\n', 'A:\\tthe hunting and everything,\\n', 'A:\\tand I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all,\\n', 'A:\\tand I, I did, used to be all in favor of it,\\n', \"A:\\tbut it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs.\\n\", 'A:\\tYet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing.\\n', \"A:\\tBut because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', 'B:\\tit, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere,\\n', \"B:\\tbut, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings\\n\", 'B:\\tand, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all,\\n', 'B:\\tand, uh.\\n', 'A:\\tWell, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was.\\n', \"A:\\tThere's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas,\\n\", 'A:\\tand I know we lived in Chicago for seven years,\\n', 'A:\\tand of course it was definitely there.\\n', \"A:\\tSo when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this.\\n\", \"A:\\tIt's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse.\\n\", \"A:\\tI don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in.\\n\", \"A:\\tI don't know whether that's it, or street gangs.\\n\", \"A:\\tI don't know what the answer is.\\n\", \"A:\\tI know that it's scary,\\n\", \"A:\\tand yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do,\\n\", \"A:\\tand that's basically what the gun control would end up being.\\n\", 'B:\\tI, I think so,\\n', \"B:\\tand, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one,\\n\", 'B:\\tand, uh, and then, uh.\\n', \"A:\\tWell, it's very true.\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', \"A:\\tIt's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun\\n\", \"A:\\tIt's the ones that are going out and stealing it.\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', 'A:\\tAnd I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them.\\n', 'A:\\tAnd I think that would almost have to go with armies, too.\\n', \"A:\\tI mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.\\n\", 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', 'B:\\tyeah,\\n', \"B:\\tthat's for sure.\\n\", 'A:\\tBecause even if you said, okay,\\n', 'A:\\tyou know, armed forces could have them,\\n', 'A:\\tsome idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah,\\n', 'B:\\tand, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh,\\n', \"B:\\tand if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.\\n\", \"A:\\tThat's very true\\n\", 'A:\\tvery true.\\n', 'A:\\tWho knows,\\n', 'A:\\twe maybe want to overthrow the government\\n', 'B:\\tWell, the way things are going.\\n', 'A:\\tI know,\\n', \"A:\\tif somebody doesn't do something.\\n\", \"A:\\tUh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?\\n\", 'B:\\tWell, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, uh, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.\\n', 'A:\\tYes.\\n', \"B:\\tAnd, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much,\\n\", 'B:\\tand so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.\\n', 'A:\\tOkay,\\n', 'A:\\tuh, I guess our topic is about movies\\n', 'B:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'A:\\tand, uh, what is coincidence,\\n', 'A:\\twe got a baby-sitter\\n', 'A:\\tand we went to the movies that past weekend.\\n', 'B:\\tOh, so did I\\n', 'A:\\tAnd we saw CAPE FEAR.\\n', 'B:\\tOh, I heard that was excellent.\\n', 'A:\\tIt is.\\n', 'B:\\tIs it?\\n', \"A:\\tIt's really good.\\n\", 'B:\\tUh, I wanted to see that\\n', 'B:\\tI was deciding between that and, uh, MY GIRL\\n', 'B:\\tand, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.\\n', 'A:\\tOh, how was that?\\n', 'B:\\tOh, it was excellent.\\n', 'B:\\tIt was a really, really good movie.\\n', \"B:\\tI'd recommend it.\\n\", \"A:\\tI heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.\\n\", 'A:\\tIs that true?\\n', 'B:\\tUh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.\\n', 'A:\\tOh.\\n', 'B:\\tUh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.\\n', 'A:\\tOh.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', \"B:\\tUh, I don't know, though,\\n\", \"B:\\tI, I've heard that, and then what you just told me\\n\", 'B:\\tso,\\n', 'A:\\tYeah,\\n', 'A:\\tyeah,\\n', 'A:\\tbecause, uh, the little boy dies.\\n', 'B:\\tRight,\\n', 'B:\\tyeah.\\n', 'A:\\tYeah.\\n', 'B:\\tIt was sad.\\n', 'B:\\tIt was really sad.\\n', 'A:\\tOh.\\n', 'B:\\tBut, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.\\n', 'A:\\tOh.\\n', 'A:\\tOh.\\n', 'B:\\tMaybe.\\n', 'A:\\tUh-huh.\\n', 'B:\\tBut, it was really good.\\n', 'B:\\tIt was sad, very sad.\\n', 'A:\\tOh, I want to see that one.\\n', 'A:\\tWell, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.\\n', 'B:\\tYeah.\\n', 'A:\\tIt was really suspenseful.\\n', \"A:\\tSo that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.\\n\", 'B:\\tI heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent,\\n', 'B:\\tbut it was kind of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.\\n', 'A:\\tUh, no,\\n', 'A:\\tand it, uh, it was kind of,\\n', \"A:\\tI don't know,\\n\", \"A:\\tit's kind of both, I guess,\\n\", \"A:\\tbut it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.\\n\", 'B:\\tOh, really?\\n', \"A:\\tBut, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.\\n\", 'B:\\tOh.\\n', 'A:\\tAnd it, it was a real good movie.\\n', 'A:\\tAnd then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Because we have two kids.
